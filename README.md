# RealLifeCompSci
For now, just a text file where I write down crazy ideas that I have about implementing theories and stuff from Computer Science in real life. Look at the readme if you're confused.

A LOT (if not all) of these will be barely more than a "what-if" that crosses my mind at some point during the day. So please don't make fun of me if it's a stupid idea ;-;

## Thought 1
----
Implementing a cities layout using a Tree data structure (with weighted branches). Alright, so a graph. Would this lead to O(logn) travel performance? Investigate / research into the data structures further.
